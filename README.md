# ToastViewEample
Toast View Design As Android in Swiftui

This repository contains a ToastView implementation for SwiftUI, which can be used to display short-lived informational messages to the user.

# Usage
To use the ToastView, simply add the toast extension to any view, passing in a boolean binding that controls whether the toast should be shown or hidden, and a closure that returns the ToastView instance with the desired message to display.
